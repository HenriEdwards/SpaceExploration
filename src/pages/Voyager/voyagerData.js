    "The Voyager program consists of two spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, launched in 1977 to explore the outer planets of our solar system. They have provided unprecedented data on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, along with their moons and rings. Voyager 1 is now the farthest human-made object from Earth, having entered interstellar space in 2012, while Voyager 2 followed in 2018."
